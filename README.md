# Software Development Showcase
First of all, thank you for considering my application for the rule, I hope you find my work competent and sufficient.

I have decided to include a sample of my work from different areas to better demonstrate my skills. Below are brief descriptions and you can find the complete work on each corresponding folder.

Thank you.

## Sample 01: Web Design
### __Description__

This was my project for Introduction to Web Design (DECO1400).
It was focused more on the fundamentals of web design rather than web development.

## Sample 02: Python Desktop Application
### __Description__

This was my contribution to my ENGG4810 team project. This application
was made in Python and used to communicate with firmware to receive data
and plot them in real time and storing, loading log files and applying
mask testing on the plot.
